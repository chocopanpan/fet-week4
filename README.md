# fet-week4

This assignement was one of my favorites.  With this one, we had to create a table.  With that table we were to create a form in which the information submitted by the form would fill in a new row to the table.  It was a bit tricky at the beginning, but I was able to get things to work out.  The topic of this assignment was CardCaptor Sakura.  I basically made a table of 3 columns.  There were 2 already prefilled rows.  With the form, you create a 3rd row and onward.
